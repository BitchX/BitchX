Under UNIX SV we need to change include/irc.h and remove 
 #include <arpa/inet.h> from the file. This causes a couple of new 
warnings in dcc.c to appear, but everything works as advertised.

HPUX seems to have some header files problems.
in particular. #include <sys/types.h> can't be included before #include
<time.h> or #include <sys/time.h>

OpenBSD uses pax instead of GNU cpio.  Since pax does not support the -R
flag, remove "-R `id -un`:`id -gn`" from the cpio command under the 
installhelp section of the Makefile after running the configure script.
